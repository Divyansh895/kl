International School Library has four libraries stocked with ample reference material to inculcate love for reading. Our librarians and teachers encourage the children to choose books according to their taste. What cannot be completed in school can be at home. We find that our children are improving not only in the subject matter chosen for reading, but also in language, expression, vocabulary and fluency.</p>

The food options and responsiblites to consider , canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past.Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descripitions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices.Each student or staff members who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietery requirements that may have, Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike.Here again, diverstiy is the key.
